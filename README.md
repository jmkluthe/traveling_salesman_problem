To run the simulated annealing algorithm replace the filenames in the 'filenames' list at the bottom of
simulated_annealing.py with the filenames containing the input data. Then replace the value of '180' in the function
call to 'simulated_annealing()' inside the function 'run_annealing()' with the number of seconds you wish to run the
algorithm for. Then, simply call 'python simulated_annealing.py' or 'python3 simulated_annealing.py' on the
command line.

To run the nearest neighbor algorithm, simply replace the value of the variable 'inputfilename' at the top of
nearest_neighbor.py with the filename containing the input data you want to run. Then call 'python nearest_neighbor.py'
or 'python3 nearest_neighbor.py' on the command line.

**NOTE: We used the Nearest Neighbor Algorithm for the competition.**
